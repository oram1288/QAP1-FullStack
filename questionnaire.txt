Questionnaire:

1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep 
try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual 
part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

- Between 2-3 hours for 4 days, looking for info on the core objects and code.

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

- I used your lectures and some youtube videos.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. 
(If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

- Just asked reagan to confirm the right way on how to format the folder/files for the QAP.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many 
questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

- No.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, 
and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem 
requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

- Don't think the QAP was hard, just took some time to do some research and find some code you 
liked to test it.
